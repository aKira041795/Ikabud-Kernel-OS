# Stress & Load Test Findings — April 16, 2026

## Executive Summary

The Ikabud Kernel Application OS platform was subjected to a two-part evaluation: (1) an architectural stress test exercising 8 internal scenarios with 56 assertions, and (2) an HTTP-level load test measuring real concurrent user performance across 4 traffic profiles and 5 concurrency levels.

**Key findings:**
- **Zero data corruption** across all stress scenarios. Oversell prevention, tenant isolation, and cross-module failure isolation all hold under pressure.
- **Zero HTTP errors** (0% error rate) at all concurrency levels tested (1–50 simultaneous connections).
- **Throughput ceiling** at approximately **3.8–4.1 req/s** — the server saturates at ~5 concurrent users and additional connections only add latency, not throughput.
- **Latency degrades linearly** beyond 5 concurrent users. At 50 concurrent, median response time is ~11 seconds.
- **Estimated real-world capacity**: 15–25 simultaneous page-viewing users before user experience degrades noticeably.
- **Ecommerce catalog caching** implemented: file-based, tag-invalidated, 300s TTL. Micro-benchmarks show **70–187× speedup** on cache hits at the query layer.
- **Page-level output cache** implemented: kernel-level file cache with 300s TTL (event-driven invalidation) for all public GET pages, plus cache stampede protection via flock().
- **DiSyL extends resolution cache** implemented: cross-request file cache for template inheritance chain resolution, reducing per-request CPU on cache misses.
- **Stock gate enforced** in `ecOrderCreate()`: orders now fail with 409 when stock is insufficient instead of silently accepting.
- **OPcache enabled** (was disabled on this server): eliminates 300–500ms of PHP compilation overhead per request.
- **APCu installed**: in-memory L1 cache tier now active for kernel cache reads (tenant host records, page cache metadata).
- **Fast-path pre-bootstrap cache** implemented (`src/helpers/fast-path-cache.php`): serves cached pages **before kernel boot** — no autoloading, no module-manager, no DB. Cache hits served in **~2ms** via direct file read + APCu L1 promotion. Cumulative HTTP-level improvements (vs baseline, now with OPcache+fast-path): **+541% storefront throughput**, **−99% p50 storefront latency** (3,465ms → 44ms), **+792% shopping journey throughput**.
- **Cache TTL segmentation**: CMS pages → 600s, ecommerce pages → 180s, default → 300s.
- **Bluehost shared hosting projection**: ~1.5–3 req/s effective throughput with 2–8 concurrent PHP workers. Acceptable for up to ~10 simultaneous users on Plus/Choice Plus plans; Basic plan caps at ~40,000 visits/month (~55/hour average).

## 2. Architectural Stress Test Results

**File:** `tests/stress_architecture_test.php`
**Result:** 56 passed, 0 failed

### Scenario Summary

| # | Scenario | Assertions | Status | Key Finding |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Concurrent Orders (Oversell Prevention) | 8/8 | PASS | Atomic `WHERE stock >= qty` guard prevents negative stock. 20 concurrent decrements on 8 stock: exactly 8 succeed, 12 rejected, final stock = 0. |
| 2 | Cross-Module Event Chain Failure Isolation | 5/5 | PASS | A poisoned event listener throws an exception → order still succeeds, healthy listeners still fire, exception is logged. Event bus catches and isolates per-listener failures. |
| 3 | Module Failure Injection / Safe Degradation | 3/3 | PASS | Stock drains to exactly 0; extra order attempts don't go negative. Transaction integrity holds under partial failure. |
| 4 | Repetition Consistency | 3/3 | PASS | 20 create→cancel→restock cycles in 879ms. Final stock equals initial (50). No state drift. |
| 5 | Mixed Operations | 5/5 | PASS | Interleaved admin stock adjustments + customer orders maintain consistency. Status chain `pending→processing→shipped→delivered` enforced; invalid reverse transitions rejected. |
| 6 | Tenant Isolation | 5/5 | PASS | ModuleDB blocks cross-module writes (ecommerce cannot UPDATE cms_content). Read-only cross-module access (reads_tables) works. Tenant resolver stable across repeated calls. |
| 7 | CMS Content CRUD Integrity | 19/19 | PASS | Capability-driven create/read/update works. Slug uniqueness: 10 posts with same base slug all get unique slugs. Taxonomy assign/re-sync works. 50 rapid CRUD cycles in 791ms. 100 DiSyL inline renders with 0 errors in 8ms. |
| 8 | CMS + Ecommerce Cross-Module Integration | 8/8 | PASS | Product created via CMS capability → stock attach → decrement/increment → order creation. Full cross-module lifecycle works. |

### Architecture Integrity Assessment

| Property | Verified | Evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Atomic stock guard | Yes | `UPDATE ... WHERE stock >= qty` with rowCount check |
| Event bus fault tolerance | Yes | Per-listener try/catch, chain continues after failure |
| ModuleDB write isolation | Yes | Cross-module writes denied with logged warning |
| Cross-module read access | Yes | `reads_tables` manifest key honored |
| Transaction rollback | Yes | Stock never goes negative even under error conditions |
| Tenant resolver stability | Yes | Same tenant ID across repeated calls within request |
| CMS slug collision resolution | Yes | `cmsEnsureUniqueSlug()` appends -2, -3... correctly |
| DiSyL render stability | Yes | 100 renders, 0 errors, 8ms total |
| Cross-module capability bridge | Yes | CMS capabilities create products usable by ecommerce |

### Known Architecture Gaps (Not Bugs — Design Decisions)

1. ~~**Order pipeline does not enforce stock gate.**~~ **RESOLVED.** `ecOrderCreate()` now checks the return value of `ecProductDecrementStock()`. If stock is insufficient, the transaction is rolled back and a 409 exception is thrown with product-specific error details. The checkout handler returns a user-friendly "out of stock" message. Stress test Scenario 1 confirms: exactly N orders succeed when N stock is available; excess orders are rejected.

2. **No optimistic concurrency control on CMS content.** Rapid concurrent updates to the same content row would result in last-write-wins. The system doesn't use version columns or ETags.

### 3.3 Concurrency Ramp — Raw Data

| Concurrent | Requests | RPS | p50 | p95 | p99 | Error% | Verdict |
|-----------|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| 1 | 50 | 2.0/s | 475 ms | 691 ms | 777 ms | 0% | OK |
| 5 | 50 | 3.8/s | 1,272 ms | 1,757 ms | 1,847 ms | 0% | OK |

---

## 4. Performance Analysis

### 4.1 Throughput Ceiling

The server hits a hard throughput ceiling at approximately **3.8–4.1 requests/second** regardless of concurrency level. This is visible in the ramp data:

```
Concurrency:  1 → 5 → 10 → 25 → 50
RPS:          2.0  3.8  3.8  4.1  3.9
```

Throughput nearly doubles from 1→5 concurrent (utilizing idle CPU while waiting on DB I/O), then flatlines. This indicates the bottleneck is **CPU-bound PHP processing** on the 2-core i3, not I/O wait.

### 4.2 Latency Scaling Model

From the observed data, latency scales roughly linearly with concurrency once past the saturation point (~5 concurrent):

| Metric | Formula (ms) | R² fit |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| p50 | ≈ 200 × concurrency | ~0.98 |
| p95 | ≈ 230 × concurrency | ~0.96 |

This is consistent with **queuing theory (Little's Law)**: when throughput is fixed at ~4 req/s and you add more concurrent requests, each request waits longer in the Apache prefork queue.

### 4.3 User Experience Thresholds

| Response Time | User Perception | Concurrency Level (this server) |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| < 1 second | Feels instant | 1–3 concurrent |
| 1–3 seconds | Noticeable delay, tolerable | 4–10 concurrent |
| 3–5 seconds | Frustrating, some abandonment | 10–15 concurrent |
| 5–10 seconds | Poor experience, high abandonment | 15–25 concurrent |
| > 10 seconds | Unacceptable for interactive use | 25+ concurrent |

## 5. Predicted Performance by Load Volume

### 5.1 Current Server (i3-2100, 4 threads, Apache prefork, no caching)

| Concurrent Users | Est. RPS | Est. p50 (ms) | Est. p95 (ms) | Error Rate | UX Rating |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | 2.6 | 377 | 435 | 0% | Excellent |

| 100 | ~4.0 | ~20,000+ | ~25,000+ | ~5-15% | Timeout failures expected |

### 5.2 With OPcache Enabled (Estimated 2–3× improvement)

PHP OPcache eliminates repeated script compilation. Expected throughput: **8–12 req/s**.

| Concurrent Users | Est. RPS | Est. p50 (ms) | Est. p95 (ms) | UX Rating |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | 5–7 | 150–200 | 250 | Excellent |
| 5 | 8–12 | 400–600 | 800 | Excellent |
| 10 | 10–12 | 800–1,200 | 1,500 | Good |
| 25 | 10–12 | 2,000–2,500 | 3,500 | Acceptable |
| 50 | 10–12 | 4,000–5,000 | 7,000 | Poor |

### 5.3 With OPcache + Page/Query Caching (Estimated 10–20× improvement)

Adding Redis/APCu for rendered page fragments and query caching. Expected throughput: **25–50 req/s**.

| Concurrent Users | Est. RPS | Est. p50 (ms) | Est. p95 (ms) | UX Rating |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | 25–40 | 30–50 | 80 | Excellent |
| 10 | 30–50 | 200–300 | 500 | Excellent |
| 25 | 30–50 | 500–700 | 1,200 | Good |
| 50 | 30–50 | 1,000–1,500 | 2,500 | Acceptable |
| 100 | 30–50 | 2,000–3,000 | 5,000 | Acceptable |

### 5.4 Production-Grade Setup (Estimated 50–200× improvement)

4-core modern CPU + SSD + nginx + PHP-FPM + OPcache + Redis + MySQL tuning.

| Concurrent Users | Est. RPS | Est. p50 (ms) | Est. p95 (ms) | UX Rating |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | 100–200 | 10–20 | 30 | Excellent |
| 25 | 150–300 | 80–150 | 300 | Excellent |
| 50 | 150–300 | 150–300 | 500 | Excellent |
| 100 | 150–300 | 300–600 | 1,000 | Good |
| 250 | 100–250 | 800–1,500 | 2,500 | Acceptable |
| 500 | 80–200 | 2,000–4,000 | 6,000 | Poor |

### 5.5 Scaling Recommendations by User Volume

| Target Concurrent Users | Minimum Required |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| 1–5 | Current setup works fine |
| 5–15 | Enable OPcache (`opcache.enable=1`) |
| 15–50 | OPcache + query caching (Redis/APCu) |
| 50–100 | Switch to nginx + PHP-FPM, dedicated DB |
| 100–500 | Horizontal scaling (load balancer + multiple app servers) |
| 500+ | CDN for static assets + read replicas + application caching layer |

## 6. Bluehost Shared Hosting — Projected Performance

### 6.1 Bluehost Shared Hosting Environment Profile

Data sourced from Bluehost plan documentation and independent benchmarks (Cybernews, WebsitePlanet, ToolTester — all 2024–2026 testing cycles).

| Component | Bluehost Shared | Our Dev Server | Impact |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| CPU | Shared Xeon (oversubscribed, fractional core) | Dedicated i3-2100, 2 cores | Bluehost worse (~0.5–1 effective core per account) |
| RAM | Shared, ~512 MB–1 GB per account | 16 GB (8 GB available) | Bluehost much more constrained |
| Disk | NVMe SSD | HDD, 93% full | **Bluehost significantly better** (~100× less I/O latency) |
| PHP | 8.x with OPcache enabled | 8.3.6, no OPcache | **Bluehost better** (OPcache = 2–3× less compile overhead) |
| Web Server | Apache (suPHP or PHP-FPM with per-account limits) | Apache prefork (no process caps) | Bluehost has hard worker limits |
| PHP Workers | ~2–5 concurrent per account (plan dependent) | Unlimited (limited only by CPU/RAM) | Bluehost has hard ceiling |
| MySQL | Shared, max 150 concurrent connections | Dedicated, no practical limit | Comparable for low traffic |
| Memory Limit | 128–256 MB per PHP process | 512 MB+ per process | Bluehost tighter |
| Max Execution | 30–60 seconds | No limit | Bluehost will kill slow requests |
| Network | Utah DC → internet (real latency) | Loopback (0ms RTT) | Bluehost adds 20–200ms RTT |
| Neighbors | Hundreds of co-hosted accounts | None (dedicated) | Bluehost has "noisy neighbor" risk |

### 6.2 Known Bluehost Performance Benchmarks (Third-Party)

Independent test results for WordPress sites on Bluehost shared hosting:

| Source | Metric | Result | Year |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Cybernews | TTFB | 462 ms | 2025 |
| Cybernews | LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | 897 ms | 2025 |
| Cybernews | Stress test (50 VU) | Passed, flat response curve | 2025 |
| Cybernews | HTTP failures under 50 VU | 0 | 2025 |
| Cybernews | Uptime (30 days) | 100% | 2025 |
| WebsitePlanet | Typical page load | ~2 seconds | 2025 |
| WebsitePlanet | TTFB range (24h) | 1.0–2.5 seconds | 2025 |
| WebsitePlanet | Load time range (24h) | 1.2–4.5 seconds | 2025 |
| WebsitePlanet | US West Coast (Sucuri) | ~500 ms full load | 2025 |
| WebsitePlanet | Uptime (30 days) | 100% | 2025 |
| ToolTester | Page load time | 2.07 seconds | 2022 |
| ToolTester | Page load (previous year) | 2.87 seconds | 2021 |
| ToolTester | Uptime | 99.95% | 2022 |

> **Key observation:** These benchmarks are for lightweight WordPress sites with caching plugins. Our app (custom PHP framework + DiSyL templating + no page cache) is significantly heavier per request. WordPress with object caching can serve pages in ~50–100ms of PHP time; our app uses ~400–700ms of PHP time per storefront page.

### 6.3 Adjustment Methodology: Dev Server → Bluehost Shared

To translate our measured performance to Bluehost shared hosting, we apply these factors:

| Factor | Effect | Multiplier |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| NVMe SSD vs HDD | Faster file I/O, faster MySQL reads | **0.7×** latency (30% faster) |
| OPcache enabled | Eliminates PHP recompilation (~100+ files/request) | **0.5×** latency (50% faster) |
| Shared CPU (oversubscribed) | Fractional core vs dedicated 2-core | **1.5–2.5×** latency (slower) |
| Memory pressure | Swapping risk, smaller buffers | **1.1–1.3×** latency |
| Network RTT | Real internet vs loopback | **+30–150ms** per request |
| Noisy neighbors | Unpredictable CPU/IO spikes | **1.0–2.0×** variance |
| PHP worker cap | Hard limit on concurrent requests | Queuing + 503 errors at limit |

**Net single-user adjustment:** 0.7 × 0.5 × 2.0 × 1.2 + 80ms RTT ≈ **0.84× our p50 + 80ms**

For our API endpoint (p50 = 377ms on dev): 377 × 0.84 + 80 ≈ **397ms** on Bluehost (single user, calm server)
For our storefront (p50 = 691ms on dev): 691 × 0.84 + 80 ≈ **660ms** on Bluehost (single user, calm server)

These align well with Bluehost's published TTFB of 462ms for WordPress — our app is heavier, and we're predicting ~400–660ms baseline. Under neighbor pressure, add 50–200% variance.

### 6.4 Bluehost Plan Comparison — Predicted Performance for This App

#### Basic Plan ($2.95/mo intro → $6.99/mo renewal)

10 GB NVMe | 40,000 visits/month | ~2 effective PHP workers | Standard CPU

| Concurrent Users | Est. RPS | Est. p50 (ms) | Est. p95 (ms) | Error Rate | UX Rating |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | 1.5–2.5 | 400–700 | 800–1,500 | 0% | Good |
| 2 | 2.0–3.0 | 600–1,000 | 1,200–2,000 | 0% | Good |
| 3 | 2.0–3.0 | 900–1,500 | 1,800–3,000 | 0–5% | Acceptable |
| 5 | 2.0–3.0 | 1,500–2,500 | 3,000–5,000 | 5–15% | Poor |
| 10 | 2.0–3.0 | 3,000–5,000 | 5,000–10,000 | 15–30% | Very Poor |

**Monthly capacity:** ~40,000 pageviews. At 5 pages/visit average = ~8,000 visits/month = ~267 visits/day.
**Verdict:** Suitable for a single low-traffic tenant site (< 50 visits/day). Will struggle with any marketing spike.

#### Plus / Choice Plus Plan ($4.95–5.45/mo intro → $9.99–11.99/mo renewal)

50 GB NVMe | 200,000 visits/month | ~3–5 effective PHP workers | Standard CPU

| Concurrent Users | Est. RPS | Est. p50 (ms) | Est. p95 (ms) | Error Rate | UX Rating |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | 2.0–3.0 | 350–600 | 700–1,200 | 0% | Good |
| 3 | 3.0–5.0 | 600–1,000 | 1,200–2,000 | 0% | Good |
| 5 | 3.0–5.0 | 1,000–1,800 | 2,000–3,500 | 0–3% | Acceptable |
| 10 | 3.0–5.0 | 2,000–3,500 | 4,000–6,000 | 3–10% | Poor |
| 15 | 3.0–5.0 | 3,000–5,000 | 6,000–10,000 | 10–20% | Very Poor |
| 25 | 2.5–4.0 | 5,000–8,000 | timeout | 25–50% | Unusable |

**Monthly capacity:** ~200,000 pageviews = ~40,000 visits/month = ~1,333 visits/day.
**Verdict:** Workable for a small–medium tenant site with steady daily traffic. Handles small social media spikes but will degrade on viral traffic.

#### Pro Plan ($13.95/mo intro → $19.99/mo renewal)

100 GB NVMe | 400,000 visits/month | ~5–8 effective PHP workers | Optimized CPU

| Concurrent Users | Est. RPS | Est. p50 (ms) | Est. p95 (ms) | Error Rate | UX Rating |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | 2.5–4.0 | 300–500 | 600–1,000 | 0% | Excellent |
| 5 | 4.0–6.0 | 700–1,200 | 1,400–2,500 | 0% | Good |
| 10 | 4.0–6.0 | 1,400–2,500 | 3,000–5,000 | 0–5% | Acceptable |
| 15 | 4.0–6.0 | 2,000–3,500 | 4,000–7,000 | 3–10% | Poor |
| 25 | 3.5–5.0 | 3,500–6,000 | 7,000–12,000 | 10–25% | Very Poor |
| 50 | 3.0–4.5 | timeout | timeout | 30–60% | Unusable |

**Monthly capacity:** ~400,000 pageviews = ~80,000 visits/month = ~2,667 visits/day.
**Verdict:** Best shared option. Handles moderate daily traffic and small spikes. Still not viable for sustained high concurrency (> 15 simultaneous users).

| Max concurrent (before errors) | 50+ | ~5–8 | ~12–15 | ~20–25 |
| Monthly visit capacity | Unlimited | 8,000 | 40,000 | 80,000 |
| Error behavior at overload | Latency degrades, 0% errors | 503 Service Unavailable | 503 Service Unavailable | 503 Service Unavailable |
| Disk I/O | HDD (slow) | NVMe SSD (fast) | NVMe SSD (fast) | NVMe SSD (fast) |
| OPcache | Disabled | Enabled | Enabled | Enabled |

> **Critical difference:** Our dev server degrades gracefully — latency climbs but requests never fail (0% error at 50 concurrent). Bluehost shared hosting has a hard PHP worker ceiling. When all workers are busy, additional requests receive **503 Service Unavailable** immediately rather than queuing.

### 6.6 Bluehost-Specific Risk Factors

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Noisy neighbor** — co-hosted site gets traffic spike | 2–5× latency increase, possible 503 | Medium-High | None (move to VPS/cloud) |
| **PHP worker exhaustion** — all workers busy | Immediate 503 for new requests | High at >10 concurrent | Page caching, reduce per-request time |
| **30-second execution timeout** — heavy page takes too long | Request killed, blank page or 500 | Medium (storefront pages ~0.7–1s normally) | OPcache + query cache reduce to <0.5s |
| **Memory limit (128–256MB)** — large CMS pages or product lists | Fatal error, white screen | Low-Medium (our app uses ~50–100MB) | Optimize memory, paginate queries |
| **Visit cap enforcement** — Basic 40K, Plus 200K, Pro 400K/month | Account throttled or suspended | Medium (depends on marketing success) | Monitor usage, upgrade plan proactively |
| **No uptime SLA on shared plans** — extended outages | Site down, no compensation | Low (100% measured by reviewers) | Accept risk or move to cloud plan (has SLA) |
| **TTFB variance** — 0.5s to 2.5s throughout the day | Inconsistent user experience | High (documented by WebsitePlanet) | CDN, page cache, or move to VPS |
| **Rate limiting** — Bluehost may throttle sustained API traffic | API consumers get 429/503 | Medium for API-heavy use cases | Cache API responses, reduce call frequency |

### 6.7 Recommended Bluehost Plan by Use Case

| Use Case | Recommended Plan | Monthly Budget | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| Single tenant site, < 50 visits/day | Basic | $6.99/mo | Adequate but no headroom |
| Small tenant site (CMS + ecommerce), < 500 visits/day | Plus | $9.99/mo | Good fit, handles small social spikes |
| Growing business, < 2,000 visits/day | Pro | $19.99/mo | Works with optimization (caching needed) |
| Marketing-driven, unpredictable traffic | **Cloud hosting** | $29.99+/mo | Shared hosting is not viable |
| Multiple tenant sites | **VPS or Cloud** | $46.99+/mo | Shared plans can't handle multi-tenant load |

### 6.8 Performance Optimization Priority for Bluehost Deployment

Since Bluehost already provides OPcache and NVMe SSD (our two biggest dev-server bottlenecks are already solved), the optimization priority shifts:

| Priority | Optimization | Expected Impact | Effort |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | ~~**Add page-level caching**~~ | **DONE** — kernel-level page cache, 300s TTL + stampede protection + ETag/304 (see Section 11) | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | ~~**Add query result caching**~~ | **DONE** — ecommerce catalog cache implemented (70–187× on cache hits) | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | ~~**Enable OPcache**~~ | **DONE** — enabled on local server (was disabled). Eliminates 300–500ms PHP compilation per request. Combined with fast-path: storefront p50 3,465ms → 44ms | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | ~~**Pre-bootstrap fast-path cache**~~ | **DONE** — `src/helpers/fast-path-cache.php` serves cache hits in ~2ms before kernel boots. +541% storefront throughput vs baseline (see Section 14) | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | ~~**APCu in-memory L1 cache**~~ | **DONE** — installed and wired as L1 tier. Tenant host records + page cache entries promoted to APCu on first file read | ✅ Complete |
| 6 | ~~**Optimize DiSyL template compilation**~~ | **DONE** — cross-request extends resolution cache (file-based, filemtime-validated) | ✅ Complete |
| 7 | ~~**Add stock gate to `ecOrderCreate()`**~~ | **DONE** — orders now fail with 409 when stock is insufficient. Transaction rolled back, user-friendly error returned | ✅ Complete |
| 8 | **Enable Cloudflare CDN** (free, included with Bluehost) for static assets | Reduces server load by 30–50% for repeat visitors | Low |
| 9 | **Implement HTTP cache headers** (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`) on public pages | Browser caching eliminates repeat page loads from same user | Low |
| 10 | **Lazy-load product images** and paginate API responses | Reduces page weight and DB query load | Low |

With optimizations 1–4 implemented, projected Bluehost Plus performance:

| Concurrent Users | Est. RPS | Est. p50 (ms) | Est. p95 (ms) | Error Rate | UX Rating |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | 10–20 | 50–150 (cached) | 300–600 | 0% | Excellent |
| 5 | 15–30 | 100–300 (cached) | 500–1,000 | 0% | Excellent |
| 10 | 15–30 | 300–600 | 800–1,500 | 0% | Good |
| 25 | 10–20 | 800–1,500 | 2,000–3,500 | 0–5% | Acceptable |
| 50 | 8–15 | 2,000–3,500 | 4,000–7,000 | 5–15% | Poor |

> With caching, a Bluehost Plus plan can realistically serve 15–25 concurrent users with acceptable latency — a 3–5× improvement over uncached.

## 7. Bottleneck Analysis (Dev Server)

### Primary Bottlenecks (in order of impact)

1. **CPU-bound PHP execution** — The i3-2100's 2 physical cores are the limiting factor. Throughput flatlines at ~4 req/s regardless of concurrency. Every additional request queues behind ongoing PHP execution.

2. **No OPcache** — Each request recompiles all PHP files from source. For a framework with ~100+ included files per request, this is a major overhead. OPcache alone would likely double throughput.

3. **Apache prefork MPM** — Each concurrent request requires its own Apache child process. At 50 concurrent, that's 50 processes × ~30–50 MB each = 1.5–2.5 GB RAM consumed just for connection handling. PHP-FPM with worker pools would be more memory-efficient.

4. **Synchronous DB queries** — DiSyL template rendering and CMS content queries hit MySQL synchronously. Ecommerce catalog queries now have a file-based cache layer (see Section 10), but CMS content queries and template rendering remain uncached.

5. **HDD I/O** — The system runs on spinning disk (93% full). Random read latency on HDD is ~10ms vs ~0.1ms on SSD. This affects both PHP file reads and MySQL data access.

### What Is NOT a Bottleneck

- **Memory**: 8 GB available is adequate for this load range
- **MySQL connections**: Not hitting connection limits at any tested concurrency
- **Network**: Loopback eliminates network latency; production CDN would help
- **Application correctness**: 0% error rate at all levels — the app handles load gracefully, just slowly

---

## 8. Security Observations from Load Testing

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| CSRF protection blocks unauthorized POSTs | Verified — cart/add returns 500 without token |
| Session cookies set HttpOnly + SameSite=Strict | Verified |
| CSP headers present on all responses | Verified |
| No information leakage under load | Verified — error pages don't expose internals |
| ModuleDB write isolation holds under stress | Verified — logged and blocked |
| No session fixation under rapid connection cycling | Verified — each session gets unique PHPSESSID |

---

## 9. Recommendations — Priority Order

### Immediate (No code changes)
1. **Enable OPcache** — `opcache.enable=1`, `opcache.memory_consumption=128`, `opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000`. Expected: 2–3× throughput.
2. **Upgrade to SSD** — 93% disk usage on HDD is a performance and reliability risk.

### Short-term (Minor code changes)
3. ~~**Add query result caching** for hot paths~~ — **DONE.** Ecommerce catalog caching implemented (see Section 10). Product listings, product detail, and slug lookups are now cached with tag-based invalidation and 300s default TTL. CMS blog/category caching already existed. Measured speedup: **70–187× on cache hits** at the query layer.
4. ~~**Add stock gate to `ecOrderCreate()`**~~ — **DONE.** Orders now fail with 409 and transaction rollback when `ecProductDecrementStock()` returns false. Checkout handler returns product-specific "out of stock" message. Stress test verifies: exactly N orders succeed for N stock.

### Medium-term (Architecture changes)
5. **Switch to nginx + PHP-FPM** — Better concurrency handling, lower per-connection memory overhead.
6. ~~**Add page-level caching** for public storefront pages~~ — **DONE.** Kernel-level full-page output cache with 300s TTL, tag-based invalidation, cache stampede protection (flock-based), and ETag/304 support. Cumulative measured: +44% storefront throughput, −50% p99 latency, +31% throughput ceiling.
7. ~~**Add DiSyL template compilation cache**~~ — **DONE.** Cross-request extends resolution cache added to TemplateEngine. Caches the fully-resolved template inheritance chain to disk, validated by filemtime of all files in the chain. Eliminates repeated file I/O and regex processing on subsequent requests.
8. **Consider optimistic concurrency** for CMS content (version column + conflict detection).

### Long-term (Scaling for growth)
8. **Horizontal scaling** — Separate app server(s) from database. Add load balancer.
9. **CDN for static assets** — Tailwind CSS CDN, Alpine.js CDN, and product images should be edge-cached.
10. **Read replicas** — When write volume grows, split read queries to replica(s).

## 10. Ecommerce Catalog Cache Layer — Implementation & Measured Impact

### 10.1 Implementation Summary

A file-based cache layer was added to the ecommerce module, mirroring the existing CMS cache architecture.

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Cache helper | `modules/ecommerce/helpers/29-cache.php` |
| Instance ID | `ec_t{tenantId}` (tenant-scoped) |
| Storage | File-based via kernel `Cache` (gzip for entries >1 KB, atomic writes) |
| Default TTL | 300 seconds (configurable via module settings) |
| Invalidation | Tag-based — product CRUD, pricing, inventory, and review changes all trigger targeted invalidation |
| Settings | `cache_enabled` (on/off) and `cache_ttl` (seconds) in module admin |

### 10.2 Cached Operations

| Function | Cache Key Pattern | Tags |
|----------|------------------|------|
| `ecProductList()` | `ec:productlist:{md5(filters)}` | `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog`, `ec:category:{id}`, `ec:store:{id}` |
| `ecProductGet()` | `ec:product:id:{id}:rel:{0\|1}` | `ec:product:{id}`, `ec:product:slug:{slug}`, `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |
| `ecProductGetBySlug()` | `ec:product:slug:{slug}:rel:{0\|1}` | Same as `ecProductGet` |

### 10.3 Invalidation Points

| Trigger | Functions Called | Tags Invalidated |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Product created | `ecProductCreate()` | `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |
| Product updated | `ecProductUpdate()` | `ec:product:{id}`, `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |
| Product deleted | `ecProductDelete()` | `ec:product:{id}`, `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |
| Pricing changed | `ecProductUpdatePricing()` | `ec:product:{id}`, `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |
| Inventory updated | `ecProductUpdateInventory()` | `ec:product:{id}`, `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |
| Stock decremented | `ecProductDecrementStock()` | `ec:product:{id}`, `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |
| Stock incremented | `ecProductIncrementStock()` | `ec:product:{id}`, `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |
| Review added/moderated | `ecReviewInvalidateCaches()` | `ec:product:{id}`, `ec:product:slug:{slug}`, `ec:type:product`, `ec:catalog` |

### 10.4 Micro-Benchmark Results (Query Layer)

Measured on the dev server (i3-2100, HDD, no OPcache) with 70 products in catalog:

| Operation | Cold (cache miss) | Warm (cache hit) | Speedup |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| `ecProductList` (12 products) | 18.2 ms | 0.3 ms | **70×** |
| `ecProductGet` (with relations) | 14.7 ms | 0.1 ms | **182×** |
| `ecProductGetBySlug` (with relations) | 15.8 ms | 0.1 ms | **187×** |

### 10.5 HTTP-Level Impact Analysis

The HTTP load test shows similar end-to-end numbers because **CPU-bound PHP execution (no OPcache) dominates request time**, not database queries. The catalog query savings (~15–18 ms per request) are small relative to total request time (~400–900 ms).

However, the cache layer will deliver significant gains when combined with OPcache:
- Without OPcache: PHP compilation consumes ~300–500 ms/request, dwarfing the 15 ms DB savings
- With OPcache: PHP compilation drops to ~0 ms, making the 15 ms DB savings a much larger fraction of the remaining ~100–200 ms
- On Bluehost (OPcache + NVMe SSD): Cache hits should reduce per-request time by **30–50%** for catalog pages

### 10.6 Test Coverage

| Test File | Assertions | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `tests/ecommerce_cache_smoke_test.php` | 25 | All pass |
| `tests/ecommerce_cache_benchmark.php` | Micro-benchmarks | Cache hit 70–187× faster |
| `tests/ecommerce_ajax_catalog_search_test.php` | 10 | All pass (regression check) |
| `tests/ecommerce_store_catalog_filter_test.php` | 10 | All pass (regression check) |
| `tests/ecommerce_product_attributes_test.php` | 11 | All pass (regression check) |
| `tests/manifest_settings_defaults_test.php` | 34 | All pass (settings regression check) |

## 11. Page-Level Output Cache — Implementation & Measured Impact

### 11.1 Implementation Summary

A kernel-level full-page output cache was added that short-circuits the entire handler execution for public GET requests from unauthenticated visitors.

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Cache helper | `src/helpers/page-cache.php` |
| Instance ID | `pagecache_t{tenantId}` (tenant-scoped) |
| Storage | File-based via kernel `Cache` (gzip for entries >1 KB, atomic writes) |
| Default TTL | 300 seconds (event-driven invalidation handles freshness) |
| Invalidation | Tag-based — CMS content mutations flush CMS pages, ecommerce product/category mutations flush ecommerce pages |
| ETag support | Yes — returns 304 Not Modified when client has current version |
| Stampede protection | flock()-based lock coalescing — first request builds, others wait up to 2s |
| Integration point | `executeModuleHandler()` in `src/helpers/module-manager.php` |

### 11.2 Cache Flow

1. **Before handler execution**: Check `pageCacheShouldCache()` — if eligible (GET, no auth, not in skip list), try `pageCacheServe()`. On hit → send cached HTML with ETag, return immediately (handler never runs).
2. **On cache miss**: Acquire flock()-based lock for this URI. If lock acquired → build page, store cache, release lock. If lock held by another process → wait up to 2s polling for cache to appear; if populated, serve from cache; if timeout, proceed to build without lock.
3. **On cache miss (build)**: Execute handler normally inside `ob_start()`, capture output via `ob_get_clean()`, call `pageCacheSet()`, release lock, then echo.
4. **On content mutation**: CMS EventBus listeners and ecommerce invalidation helpers call `pageCacheInvalidateModule()` to flush all cached pages for that module.

### 11.3 Skip List (Never Cached)

Routes matching these prefixes are excluded from page caching:

`/api/`, `/admin/`, `/login`, `/logout`, `/register`, `/lock.php`, `/superadmin`, `/ecommerce/cart`, `/ecommerce/checkout`, `/ecommerce/my-orders`, `/ecommerce/my-wishlist`, `/ecommerce/recover-cart`, `/ecommerce/compare`, `/ecommerce/admin`, `/ecommerce/store-admin`, `/cms/login`, `/cms/admin`, `/cms/auth`

### 11.4 Invalidation Hooks

| Trigger | Function | Tags Flushed |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| CMS content created | `cms.content.created` EventBus | `pagecache:module:cms` |
| CMS content published | `cms.content.published` EventBus | `pagecache:module:cms` |
| CMS content updated | `cms.content.updated` EventBus | `pagecache:module:cms` |
| CMS content deleted | `cms.content.deleted` EventBus | `pagecache:module:cms` |
| CMS settings updated | `cms.settings.updated` EventBus | `pagecache:module:cms` |
| CMS cache flush | `cmsCacheFlushAll()` | `pagecache:module:cms` |
| Product CRUD | `ecCacheInvalidateProduct()` | `pagecache:module:ecommerce` |
| Category CRUD | `ecCacheInvalidateCategory()` | `pagecache:module:ecommerce` |
| Ecommerce cache flush | `ecCacheFlushAll()` | `pagecache:module:ecommerce` |

### 11.5 HTTP-Level Load Test Results — Cumulative Across All Rounds

All tests: 10 concurrent connections, 100 requests per profile.

#### Profile Comparison (5 rounds)

| Profile | Metric | Baseline | + Page cache | + TTL/stampede/extends | + OPcache + fast-path | Cumulative change |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Storefront** | Throughput | 2.7 req/s | 3.5 req/s | 3.9 req/s | **17.3 req/s** | **+541%** |
| | p50 | 3,465 ms | 2,751 ms | 2,322 ms | **44 ms** | **−99%** |
| | p95 | 6,332 ms | 4,304 ms | 4,071 ms | **2,875 ms** | **−55%** |
| | p99 | 9,137 ms | 4,710 ms | 4,562 ms | **3,175 ms** | **−65%** |
| | Wall time | 36.7s | 28.9s | 25.4s | **5.8s** | **−84%** |
| **API** | Throughput | 3.9 req/s | 4.4 req/s | 4.8 req/s | **8.3 req/s** | **+113%** |
| | p50 | 2,442 ms | 2,226 ms | 1,993 ms | **1,172 ms** | **−52%** |
| | p95 | 4,121 ms | 3,539 ms | 3,076 ms | **1,859 ms** | **−55%** |
| | p99 | 4,232 ms | 4,158 ms | 3,461 ms | **2,284 ms** | **−46%** |
| **Mixed** | Throughput | 3.2 req/s | 3.8 req/s | 4.3 req/s | **12.7 req/s** | **+297%** |
| | p50 | 2,906 ms | 2,419 ms | 2,310 ms | **627 ms** | **−78%** |
| | p95 | 5,365 ms | 4,264 ms | 3,501 ms | **1,945 ms** | **−64%** |
| | p99 | 6,994 ms | 4,818 ms | 4,214 ms | **2,692 ms** | **−61%** |
| **Shopping Journey** | Throughput | 1.3 req/s | 1.8 req/s | 2.1 req/s | **11.6 req/s** | **+792%** |
| | p50 | 689 ms | 552 ms | 479 ms | **2 ms** | **−99.7%** |
| | p95 | 1,387 ms | 708 ms | 543 ms | **428 ms** | **−69%** |
| | p99 | 1,609 ms | 805 ms | 640 ms | **555 ms** | **−65%** |

> Shopping journey p50 dropped to **2ms** — the fast-path cache serves repeated page loads directly from APCu or file, bypassing the entire kernel stack.

#### Concurrency Ramp Comparison

| Concurrency | Baseline RPS | Current RPS | Baseline p50 | Current p50 | Baseline p99 | Current p99 |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | 2.0/s | 4.0/s (+100%) | 475 ms | 238 ms (−50%) | 777 ms | 474 ms (−39%) |
| 5 | 3.8/s | 7.0/s (+84%) | 1,272 ms | 692 ms (−46%) | 1,847 ms | 1,149 ms (−38%) |
| 10 | 3.8/s | 7.7/s (+103%) | 2,542 ms | 1,196 ms (−53%) | 4,799 ms | 2,401 ms (−50%) |
| 25 | 4.1/s | 8.2/s (+100%) | 5,471 ms | 2,587 ms (−53%) | 10,619 ms | 5,953 ms (−44%) |
| 50 | 3.9/s | 7.8/s (+100%) | 11,033 ms | 3,793 ms (−66%) | 12,933 ms | 6,424 ms (−50%) |

#### Key Observations

- **Storefront p50 dropped 99%** (3,465ms → 44ms) — OPcache eliminates compilation overhead; the fast-path cache serves HTML in ~2ms; the bimodal distribution (some misses at ~3s, most hits at ~2ms) yields a p50 of 44ms at 10 concurrent.
- **Shopping journey is essentially free** on cache hits (p50 = 2ms) — repeated product page / shop views within the 300s TTL hit APCu L1 and bypass everything.
- **API throughput doubled** (3.9 → 8.3 req/s) even though API endpoints are not page-cached — OPcache eliminates PHP compilation cost and freed CPU from faster HTML responses reduces contention.
- **Throughput ceiling doubled at all concurrency levels** (3.9–5.1 → 7.8–8.2 req/s) — the fast-path releases Apache workers in microseconds on cache hits instead of seconds, allowing far more parallel capacity.
- **The bottleneck has shifted**: previously CPU-bound on PHP compilation. Now the ceiling is Apache prefork worker count on cache misses. With nginx+PHP-FPM, this would improve further.

### 11.6 Test Coverage

| Test File | Assertions | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `tests/page_cache_smoke_test.php` | 67 | All pass |
| `tests/stress_architecture_test.php` | 57 | All pass (stock gate verified in Scenario 1) |

Test sections (page cache): function availability (12, +`pageCacheTtlForModule`), instance/TTL (8, +4 per-module TTL assertions), eligibility checks (16), key determinism (4), cache tags (4), set/get round-trip (7), per-module invalidation (5), URL-specific invalidation (2), full flush (3), cross-module hooks (3), log checks (2).

## 12. Stock Gate Enforcement — Implementation

### 12.1 Change Summary

`ecOrderCreate()` now enforces the stock gate: when `ecProductDecrementStock()` returns `false` (insufficient stock), a `RuntimeException` with code 409 is thrown, rolling back the entire transaction (order row, all preceding items, address meta).

### 12.2 Affected Paths

| Caller | Handler | Stock error behavior |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Web checkout | `modules/ecommerce/handlers/86-api-checkout.php` | Catches 409, returns user-friendly "out of stock" JSON with product title |
| POS | `modules/ecommerce/helpers/60-pos.php` | Exception propagates to POS API handler |
| Capability API | `modules/ecommerce/helpers/00-init.php` | Exception propagates to capability caller |

### 12.3 Error Response Format (web checkout)

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Sorry, \"Product Name\" is out of stock or has insufficient quantity. Please update your cart and try again."
}
```

HTTP status: **409 Conflict**

### 12.4 Verification

Stress test Scenario 1 confirms: product with 5 stock, 10 order attempts → exactly 5 succeed, 5 rejected, final stock = 0. No negative stock, no silent acceptance of out-of-stock orders.

---

## 13. DiSyL Extends Resolution Cache — Implementation

### 13.1 Overview

A cross-request file cache was added to the DiSyL TemplateEngine's `processExtends()` method. Template inheritance chain resolution (reading parent layout files + regex block merging) depends only on file contents, not runtime context. The merged result is cached to disk and reused on subsequent requests until any file in the chain changes.

### 13.2 How It Works

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Cache key | `md5(templatePath)` |
| Storage | `storage/cache/disyl-extends/{hash}.cache` (serialized PHP) |
| Validation | Every file in the extends chain is tracked with its `filemtime()`. On cache read, all mtimes are re-checked. Any change → cache miss + rebuild. |
| Atomic writes | `file_put_contents()` to `.tmp` + `rename()` — prevents serving partial content |

### 13.3 What It Skips on Cache Hit

- `file_get_contents()` calls for all parent layout files in the extends chain
- `resolveTemplatePath()` calls for each layout name
- Multiple `preg_match`/`preg_replace_callback` passes for block extraction and substitution
- Circular-extends detection walk (chain is pre-resolved)

### 13.4 Impact

On cache miss (first request or after template file edit), the full extends chain is walked and cached. On all subsequent requests, the pre-resolved template is loaded from a single file read instead of N file reads + regex processing. With OPcache, the serialized cache file itself would be cached in memory.

---

## 14. OPcache, APCu, and Pre-Bootstrap Fast-Path Cache

### 14.1 OPcache

OPcache was installed but **explicitly disabled** on this server via `/etc/php/8.3/apache2/conf.d/99-disable-opcache.ini`. Re-enabled with:

```ini
opcache.enable=1
opcache.memory_consumption=128
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=16
opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000
opcache.revalidate_freq=2
opcache.validate_timestamps=1
```

**Impact:** Eliminates ~300–500ms of PHP file compilation overhead per request. Warm requests dropped from ~1.3s to ~330ms (4× improvement on single-user latency) before any page caching.

### 14.2 APCu

Installed via `apt install php8.3-apcu`. No code changes required — the kernel `Cache` class already had APCu detection and dual-write/dual-read logic in place (see `kernel/Cache.php`). APCu now serves as:

- **L1 for tenant host lookups** — `ikabud:tenant_host:{sha1(host)}` (30s TTL)
- **L1 for page cache metadata** — promoted from file on first read, valid for remaining TTL
- **L1 for capability/admin caches** — same auto-promotion pattern

### 14.3 Pre-Bootstrap Fast-Path Cache

**File:** `src/helpers/fast-path-cache.php`

A self-contained page cache reader that runs **before `bootstrap.php`** — before Composer autoloader, before the App singleton, before module-manager, before any DB connection.

#### How It Works

| Step | Code path | Cost |
|------|-----------|------|
| 1. Parse URI + eligibility check | `$_SERVER` only | ~0.01ms |
| 2. Auth cookie scan | .env line scan + `$_COOKIE` | ~0.1ms |
| 3. Tenant ID from APCu | `apcu_fetch('ikabud:tenant_host:...')` | ~0.01ms |
| 4. Build cache file path | `md5()` operations only | ~0.01ms |
| 5a. APCu L1 read | `apcu_fetch()` | ~0.01ms → **exit** |
| 5b. File L2 read | `file_get_contents()` + `gzuncompress()` + `unserialize()` | ~1–5ms → **exit** |
| Promote to APCu L1 | `apcu_store()` | ~0.01ms (async to caller) |

On a fast-path cache hit: **no bootstrap.php, no autoload, no App, no DB, no module-manager, no event bus**.

#### Fallback Safety

Any condition that can't be resolved without the kernel causes the fast-path to `return` (not `exit`), letting the full kernel handle the request normally:
- APCu not available → fall through
- Tenant not in APCu yet (cold start) → fall through  
- Cache miss or expired entry → fall through
- Authenticated user (any auth cookie present) → fall through
- POST/non-GET request → fall through

#### APCu L1 Promotion

On a file cache hit, the entry is stored in APCu with its remaining TTL. Subsequent requests for the same URI skip even the file read — served entirely from memory.

### 14.4 Cache TTL Segmentation

`pageCacheTtlForModule()` returns a per-module TTL instead of a global constant:

| Module | TTL | Rationale |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| `cms` | 600s (10 min) | Static pages and blog posts change infrequently; event-driven invalidation handles explicit edits |
| `ecommerce` | 180s (3 min) | Product pages change more often (pricing, stock, reviews); shorter TTL as safety net |
| *(default)* | 300s (5 min) | All other modules |

### 14.5 Measured Results

| Metric | No OPcache (before) | + OPcache only | + OPcache + fast-path |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Single request (warm, cached) | 330ms | 330ms | **2ms** |
| Storefront throughput (10 conc) | 3.9 req/s | ~6 req/s est. | **17.3 req/s** |
| Shopping journey p50 | 479ms | ~300ms est. | **2ms** |
| Concurrency ceiling (50 conc) | 5.1 req/s | ~6 req/s est. | **7.8 req/s** |

## Appendix A: Test File Inventory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tests/stress_architecture_test.php` | 8-scenario architectural stress test (57 assertions, including stock gate verification) |
| `tests/load_test.php` | HTTP load test with 4 profiles + concurrency ramp |
| `tests/page_cache_smoke_test.php` | Page-level cache smoke test (67 assertions, including per-module TTL segmentation) |
| `tests/ecommerce_cache_smoke_test.php` | Ecommerce cache layer smoke test (25 assertions) |
| `tests/ecommerce_cache_benchmark.php` | Cache hit vs miss micro-benchmarks |
| `modules/ecommerce/helpers/31-inventory.php` | Fixed: `cmsDb()->rowCount()` → `query()->rowCount()` |

## Appendix B: Bug Fixed During Testing

**`ecProductDecrementStock()` in `modules/ecommerce/helpers/31-inventory.php`**

The function called `cmsDb()->execute()` which returns `bool`, then called `cmsDb()->rowCount()` which does not exist on `ModuleDB`. Fixed to use `cmsDb()->query()` which returns a `PDOStatement`, then `$stmt->rowCount()`.

This bug would have caused a fatal error on any real stock decrement attempt in production. It was masked in normal testing because the exception was caught by `ecOrderCreate()`'s transaction wrapper and the order was still created (with full stock unchanged).
