## Quick Deploy (Bluehost / cPanel)

1. **Create MySQL database** — cPanel → MySQL Databases → Create database + user → Grant ALL privileges
2. **Upload archive** — Upload `application-kernel-os.zip` to `public_html/` → Extract
3. **Run installer** — Visit `https://yourdomain.com/lock.php` → a 4-step wizard guides you through: (1) requirements check, (2) database name/user/password/host (control-plane / multi-tenant settings live under **Advanced options**), (3) site address (domain) + admin username/password/email, (4) install. If multi-tenant mode is enabled, also enter the control-plane DB settings under Advanced options.
4. **Secure** — Delete `public/lock.php` after verifying the application works

### cPanel Primary Domain Serving A Tenant CMS

Use this when the hosting account's primary domain must stay on `public_html/`, but the Kernel OS code lives in a subfolder such as `public_html/kernelappos/` and the domain should serve one tenant's CMS.

1. Install or extract the application into a subfolder such as `public_html/kernelappos/`
2. If you are creating a new CMS tenant, create it with the CMS entry module:

```bash
php ikabud tenant:create <tenant_key> zdnorte.net --entry=cms
```

If the tenant already exists, verify it resolves to the CMS entry module and then add the tenant domain in the control plane and set it as canonical:

```bash
php ikabud tenant:list
php ikabud tenant:domain:add <tenant_id> zdnorte.net
php ikabud tenant:canonical-domain:set <tenant_id> zdnorte.net
```

3. Add a root rewrite file at `public_html/.htaccess` so the domain points into the app's `public/` folder while still presenting the tenant at `/`:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

    # Force root-relative URL generation even though the code lives in /kernelappos.
    SetEnv IKABUD_BASE_PATH /

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/kernelappos/
    RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/kernelappos/public/$1 -f
    RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /kernelappos/public/$1 [L]

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/kernelappos/
    RewriteRule ^$ /kernelappos/public/index.php [QSA,L]

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/kernelappos/
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /kernelappos/public/index.php [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
```

Notes:

- This root `.htaccess` lives in the domain document root, not in `kernelappos/public/`
- Leave `kernelappos/public/.htaccess` in place; it still handles the app's front-controller rewrite once requests reach the app
- The extra file-pass-through rule is required for theme CSS, theme JS, builder assets, and other files that physically live in `kernelappos/public/assets/`
- Do not set `APP_URL` to a filesystem-style subpath such as `https://zdnorte.net/kernelappos` or `https://zdnorte.net/kernelappos/public`
- Tenant requests generate links from the current `HTTP_HOST`; `IKABUD_BASE_PATH=/` prevents `/kernelappos` from leaking into generated URLs, redirects, login forms, and CMS assets

### Bluehost Upgrade Kit For Existing Installs

If Bluehost is already running an older version and you want a package that includes both the updated files and importable SQL bundles, generate the upgrade kit locally:

```bash
php create-bluehost-upgrade-package.php
```

This creates a zip containing:

- a fresh deployment archive for the application files
- `db/app-upgrade.sql` for the primary application database
- `db/control-upgrade.sql` for the control database when multi-tenant mode is enabled
- `db/tenant-upgrade.sql` for tenant databases when tenants use separate databases
- `README-UPGRADE.txt` with the recommended import/deploy order

Use this upgrade kit for additive Bluehost upgrades where you want the SQL import to create missing tables, add newer columns, and preserve existing rows before replacing the live code.

This is now the recommended production upgrade path for older Bluehost installs. The guarded SQL bundle/import flow has been validated against a live Bluehost site.

Recommended live-upgrade order:

1. Back up the live files and every database first.
2. Generate a fresh upgrade kit from the exact commit you plan to deploy.
3. Import `db/app-upgrade.sql` into the primary application database.
4. If multi-tenant mode is enabled, import `db/control-upgrade.sql` into the control database.
5. If tenants use separate databases, import `db/tenant-upgrade.sql` into each tenant database.
6. Upload and extract the bundled application zip over the live codebase.
7. Preserve the live `.env`, `storage/`, and `public/uploads/` directories.
8. Test the kernel host, tenant hosts, and review `storage/logs/app.log` plus `storage/logs/error.log`.

Important notes:

- Always use a freshly generated guarded upgrade kit, not an older extracted SQL file.
- The SQL bundles are intended to be repeatable for partially upgraded databases and will skip already-existing guarded columns.
- Some reconciliation migrations still remove obsolete legacy tables only after canonical replacements or backfills exist.
- Do not use `public/lock.php` as the upgrade path for an already-installed production site.

## Manual Installation

### 1. Clone or Extract

Place the project files in your web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/ikabud/`).

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /path/to/ikabud
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required `.env` variables:

```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database
DB_USERNAME=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
DB_PERSISTENT=false
DB_SSL_ENABLED=false
DB_SSL_CA=
DB_SSL_CERT=
DB_SSL_KEY=
DB_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT=true

JWT_SECRET=your-random-64-char-secret
JWT_EXPIRATION=14400

# Optional: Multi-tenancy
APP_MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=0
APP_TENANT_STRATEGY=control_host
CONTROL_DB_HOST=localhost
CONTROL_DB_PORT=3306
CONTROL_DB_DATABASE=control_db
CONTROL_DB_USERNAME=control_user
CONTROL_DB_PASSWORD=control_pass
CONTROL_DB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
CONTROL_DB_PERSISTENT=false
CONTROL_DB_SSL_ENABLED=false
CONTROL_DB_SSL_CA=
CONTROL_DB_SSL_CERT=
CONTROL_DB_SSL_KEY=
CONTROL_DB_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT=true
CONTROL_DB_ENC_KEY=your-encryption-key
```

Notes:

- `APP_COOKIE_NAME` is derived automatically from `APP_URL` when it is not set.
- If the app is intentionally served from a real URL subpath, include that path in `APP_URL`.
- If a shared-hosting root domain rewrites into a subfolder install, keep `APP_URL` host-only and use `SetEnv IKABUD_BASE_PATH /` in the domain root `.htaccess` instead.
- `DB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `CONTROL_DB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` feed the kernel DB manager's centralized PDO timeout policy for primary, control, and tenant connections.
- Enable `*_DB_SSL_ENABLED=true` only after the CA or client certificate paths are present on disk; keep `*_DB_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT=true` in production.
- AI and SMS provider credentials are managed by their modules and are not required in the base `.env`.

### 4. Set Permissions

```bash
chmod -R 775 storage/
chmod -R 775 public/
```

### 5. Apache Virtual Host

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/ikabud/public

    <Directory /var/www/html/ikabud/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/ikabud-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/ikabud-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable rewrite and restart Apache:

```bash
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### 6. Run Installer

Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com/lock.php` in your browser. The installer is a WordPress-style 4-step wizard:

1. **Requirements** — checks PHP version, required extensions, and writable `storage/` / `public/`.
2. **Database** — enter the database name, username, password, and host. Click **Test Connection** to verify. The installer creates the database automatically when the account has permission. Control-plane / multi-tenant settings are under **Advanced options**.
3. **Site & Admin** — set the **Site Address (domain)** users will visit the site at (pre-filled with the detected host; this becomes `APP_URL`), plus the admin username, password, and email.
4. **Install** — review your selections and click **Install Ikabud**.

During install the installer will:

- Connect to the application database and apply `database/migrations/001_full_schema.sql`
- Bootstrap the kernel and apply pending kernel + module migrations
- Apply control-plane migrations to `CONTROL_DB_*` when multi-tenant mode is enabled
- Create the initial admin user
- Write or refresh `.env` (using the entered site address as `APP_URL`) and generate the `.installed` marker file

If you are reinstalling, the installer backs up the previous `.env` to `storage/backups/env-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.bak` before replacing it.

> **Site address / domain:** Enter the canonical public URL (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com`), or a subpath for subfolder installs (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/kernelappos`). It is written to `APP_URL` and drives generated links, cookies, and redirects. Leave it as detected when the request host is correct.

### 7. Post-Install Security

- Delete `public/lock.php`
- Verify `.env` is not web-accessible (the `.htaccess` blocks it by default)
- Confirm `storage/logs/` is not web-accessible

Once installed, `lock.php` returns **HTTP 403 "System already installed"** until `storage/.installed` is removed, so it is safe to leave in place temporarily.

## Multi-Tenant Setup

To enable multi-tenancy:

1. Set `APP_MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=1` in `.env`
2. Configure the control-plane database credentials (`CONTROL_DB_*`) and `CONTROL_DB_ENC_KEY`
3. If you are using the web installer, enter the same control DB values in the installer form so `_control` migrations run against the correct database.
4. If you are provisioning manually without the web installer, run control-plane migrations:

```bash
# Apply control-plane schema
mysql -u control_user -p control_db < control-migrations/001_control_plane_tenants.sql
mysql -u control_user -p control_db < control-migrations/002_control_plane_encrypt_db_pass.sql
mysql -u control_user -p control_db < control-migrations/003_add_canonical_domain_to_tenants.sql
mysql -u control_user -p control_db < control-migrations/004_control_plane_module_catalog.sql
mysql -u control_user -p control_db < control-migrations/005_control_plane_module_access_requests.sql
```

5. Create tenant entries in the `tenants` table
6. Create per-tenant databases and register their encrypted credentials in `kernel_tenant_db_connections`

See [tenancy-roadmap.md](tenancy-roadmap.md) for the full multi-tenancy design.

## Rebuilding the Page Builder UI

The CMS page builder is a React/Vite application. To rebuild after changes:

```bash
cd modules/cms/builder-ui
npm install
npm run build
```

For development with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Type checking:

```bash
npm run type-check
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| 500 error after install | Check `storage/logs/error.log` for PHP errors |
| Generic error page on first request | Ensure the generated `.env` is readable by the web server process |
| "Class not found" errors | Run `composer install` or verify autoloader |
| Blank page | Ensure `APP_DEBUG=true` temporarily, check error.log |
| Login redirect loop | Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set and cookie domain is correct |
| Module not loading | Check `storage/modules.json` for enabled state |
| Template errors | Clear `storage/cache/` directory |
| `Tenant DB resolution failed: Decryption failed.` | Verify the live `CONTROL_DB_ENC_KEY` was preserved across the upgrade, then audit tenant DB ciphertext with `php scripts/audit-tenant-db-crypto.php --all` |

HTTP smoke test for the installer without `curl`:

```bash
php scripts/test-install-http.php
```

Tenant DB encryption audit and repair:

```bash
php scripts/audit-tenant-db-crypto.php --all
php scripts/audit-tenant-db-crypto.php --tenant=203 --legacy-key='OLD_KEY' --apply
php scripts/audit-tenant-db-crypto.php --tenant=203 --set-password='tenant-db-password' --apply
```

Use the first command to confirm which tenant rows decrypt with the current `CONTROL_DB_ENC_KEY`. If a tenant row only decrypts with an older key, rerun with `--legacy-key=... --apply` to re-encrypt it under the current key. If the old key is unavailable, reset that tenant's DB password with `--set-password=... --apply` after confirming the real database credential.

This checks the live `lock.php` endpoint over HTTP and verifies that installed systems keep the web installer locked.
