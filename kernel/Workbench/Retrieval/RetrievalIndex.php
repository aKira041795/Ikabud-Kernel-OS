/**
 * RetrievalIndex — the repository a lane's context is drawn from.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Before this, retrieval was a directory walk and a term count, repeated on every call, owned by
 * whoever needed it. Measured 2026-09-19: the repository had per-feature file stores
 * (storage/private/comprehension, storage/private/workbench/issues, metrics.json) and a heuristic
 * scorer, but nothing reusable -- no persisted index, no incrementality, and nothing another
 * subsystem could call. So every caller re-walked the tree and scored from scratch, and an "index"
 * never existed to be kept current.
 *
 * THIS IS A CACHE OF THE REPOSITORY'S TEXT, and it is designed around three properties that make it
 * usable rather than merely present:
 *
 *   CURRENT      A document is reindexed only when its content hash changes. `isCurrent()` answers
 *                the question directly, so a caller can trust the index instead of re-reading files,
 *                and a deleted file is REMOVED rather than lingering as a stale hit.
 *   REUSABLE     index / search / forget / stats / isCurrent. No hidden state, no globals, and the
 *                root is injected, so the harness, a CLI and a test all drive the same object.
 *   EXPLAINED    Every hit carries the terms that matched it and the score they produced. A retrieval
 *                result a reader cannot interrogate is a result nobody will trust.
 *   RETIRED      A path can be material from a harness this repository no longer runs. It stays INDEXED
 *                -- the director's instruction was to keep it, because there is still something to learn
 *                from it -- but it is not handed to a lane as context unless a caller asks for it.
 *                Currency cannot do this job: see isRetired() for the measurement of why not.
 *
 * WHY FILES AND NOT A TABLE
 * Every Workbench subsystem already persists under storage/private (comprehension, issues, metrics,
 * ai-cache). A table would need a migration, MySQL 5.7 compatibility care on the deployment target
 * (no CTEs, no window functions), and a transaction to stay consistent with a filesystem it is
 * already describing. At this size -- a repository's source, a few thousand documents -- a single
 * JSON index is faster to build, atomic to write, and impossible to get out of step with the code.
 * The API is the reusable part: the storage behind it is one class, so a table can replace this file
 * without a caller changing.
 *
 * WHAT BREAKS AS THE DATA ACCUMULATES, AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT EACH (the future-proofing, in order of
 * what will bite first):
 *
 *   1. HASHING EVERY FILE ON EVERY CALL. Already addressed -- index() stats before it reads, so an
 *      unchanged tree costs a stat per file rather than a read and a hash. This is the cost that
 *      grows with the repository, and it is the first one to check if indexing slows down.
 *   2. LOADING AND REWRITING ONE JSON DOCUMENT. Fine to a few thousand documents; past that, shard
 *      the index by top-level prefix (kernel/, modules/, docs/, ...) behind the same API, and keep
 *      index.json as a manifest of shards. Nothing outside this class needs to change.
 *   3. RANKING THAT CANNOT LEARN. Lexical scoring cannot tell that `star-swarm.js` is the right answer
 *      because it served the last three tasks. recordUse() gives it that: usage is a BOUNDED boost with
 *      a half-life, so a file that has actually been used outranks one that merely mentions the words,
 *      and a file that served tasks months ago stops outranking them. Unbounded usage credit would be
 *      worse than none: the ranker would converge on what it already recommended and never recover.
 *   4. VOCABULARY THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE QUESTION. Lexical search fails when the caller asks in
 *      different words than the code uses. search() reports `confidence`, and that is the decision
 *      point for a hybrid: LOW means the local index found nothing useful and is the only honest time
 *      to reach for an online or embedding-backed retriever. Local stays the default because code is
 *      identifier-shaped -- exact names are what a searcher wants -- and because it is private,
 *      offline and free. Online is a fallback for concepts, never the first call.
 *

     * Is this path material from a retired harness -- readable for its lessons, but not current instruction?

     * back with `tools/harpp2/projects/star-swarm-galaga.json` TIED FOR FIRST with the live game code and
     * `tools/harpp2/objectives/star-swarm-galaga-p12.md` third: 110 of 1228 indexed documents were the
     * harness that had been retired the same day, and a lane briefed from them would have implemented
     * last week's harness. The staleness gate could not see it and never will: `isCurrent()` compares mtime
     * and hash, and a retired file never changes, so it is PERMANENTLY current. That gate measures
     * CHANGED; this one measures STILL TRUE, and no amount of re-indexing turns one into the other.
     *
     * DECLARED, ONCE, HERE. The alternative that was reached for first is a `str_contains($path, 'harpp2')`
     * at each call site. That reads as a coincidence rather than a policy, cannot be argued with by a
     * reader, and answers TRUE for a path that merely has the word in its name -- `tools/harpp2.md`, or a
     * file that documents the harness. A prefix list says what is meant: the retired harness's own material.
     *
     * NOT READ FROM tools/RETIRED.md, deliberately, though that file is the record of WHY. It is prose
     * with a "superseded by" table, and it names `tools/ai-autonomy.php`, `tools/ai-run.php` and
     * `tools/ai-project.php`, which this repository's own instructions still document as current drivers.
     * A predicate parsed from a narrative would retire live tools on the day someone edited a sentence, and
     * the index would then be wrong in a way no reader could see. Retirement is a policy, so it lives in
     * code where it can be reviewed and changed on purpose; RETIRED.md stays its explanation.
     *
     * Evaluated at QUERY time, not stored at index time, and that is the point. A `retired: true` flag in
     * index.json is another attribute that never changes -- the exact failure this method exists to repair.
     * Change the policy and every stored flag would contradict it while still looking authoritative. The
     * documents stay indexed because they must stay countable and reachable; they are only kept out of a
     * brief unless a caller asks for them.

     *
     * THE RANKING RULE, stated in full, because a rule that cannot be written down is not a rule:
     *
     *   1. TERM WEIGHT. A term's weight is its rarity in the corpus (idf): `cratered` discriminates,
     *      `render` does not. Measured 2026-09-19 without it: a browser-game objective ranked
     *      `kernel/App.php` and `src/helpers/module-manager.php` in the top eight on the strength of
     *      "adding", "stage", "path", "table" and "render" -- terms that say nothing about the question.
     *   2. PATH BEATS BODY. A term in the path scores PATH_TERM_BONUS, a term in the body at most
     *      BODY_TERM_CAP: `star-swarm.js` is about the swarm in a way a file mentioning it is not.
     *   3. BODY FREQUENCY SATURATES at BODY_TERM_CAP, so repeating one word cannot outrank covering
     *      the query, and the total is scaled by COVERAGE -- the share of the query's terms the document
     *      matched. Measured 2026-09-19 without it: a 11250-line handler that happened to contain six of
     *      the query's common words ranked above the 177-line file that contains the subject.
     *   4. USE BOOST, bounded and decaying -- see useBoost() for the bound and why it must decay.
     *   5. SPREAD. At most SPREAD_QUOTA hits per top-level area, with the displaced hits backfilled in
     *      score order: a lane handed eight near-copies of one directory has been given one answer.
     *      The rule can only reshuffle what the scores already ranked, never invent a hit.
     *
     * A query term that appears nowhere -- including only in retired material, which is not searchable by
     * default -- does not silently vanish: it is reported in `missing`, so a caller can tell "nothing
     * matched" from "the index is empty".
     *
     * RETIRED MATERIAL IS NOT IN THE CANDIDATE SET unless `$includeRetired` is set. The ranking rule
     * orders the documents a lane should read, and material from a harness that was retired is not one of
     * them -- see isRetired() for the measurement. Filtering BEFORE df/idf also keeps rarity honest: three
     * copies of a retired objective must not make a live term look common.

     *     place again. Measured 2026-09-19: the boost is the smallest term in the score, and that is
     *     deliberate -- it breaks ties and nudges, it does not decide;
     *   - a document with no timestamp (indexed before this existed) gets NO credit rather than
     *     permanent credit, because an undated use cannot be aged and "forever" is the one answer that
