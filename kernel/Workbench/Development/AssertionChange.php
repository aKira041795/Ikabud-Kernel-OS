/**
 * AssertionChange — telling DELETING a check apart from MOVING it.
 *
 * EXTRACTED from tools/harpp2/assertions.php when that harness was retired on 2026-09-19. It is the
 * single best thing the old machinery produced, and it is here rather than left behind because the new
 * harness needs it: a lane's probe can pass while the lane has quietly deleted or loosened the very
 * assertions that make the probe mean something.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL (lesson L8, 2026-09-17): the original guard diffed LINES, so reindenting an
 * assertion, reordering them, or splitting one test in two looked exactly like deleting a check. It
 * refused a restructure that took a spec from 28 to 52 assertions with every threshold intact. A guard
 * that blocks the work which strengthens the suite is a defect: it teaches a reader to distrust it.
 *
 * What is compared, and why each part earns its place:
 *   SET    every assertion EXPRESSION present before must still be present, with whitespace normalised
 *          and quoted strings masked -- so reindenting or rewording a message is not a removal.
 *   BOUNDS where the same assertion appears in both, a numeric bound may not become weaker:
 *          toBeGreaterThan(8) -> toBeGreaterThan(2) is a weakening and is still caught.
 *   COUNT  reported, not enforced here: growth is fine, and shrinkage is caught by SET anyway.
 *
 * Deliberate trade-off, kept from the original: masking quoted strings means swapping a selector
 * (`getByText("Save")` -> `getByText("Delete")`) is NOT flagged. That is a behaviour change rather than
 * a weakening, and treating selector edits as violations would re-introduce the false positives that
 * made the first version unusable.

     * the marker match inside ordinary words -- measured 2026-09-19, the classifier reported a COMMENT
     * saying "RETIRED ASSERTIONS" and the line `$fail = 0;` as assertions while returning null for the
     * real `$check(...)` on the next screenful. And a leading `\b` cannot match before `$`, because `$`
     * is not a word character, so `\$check\(` written inside a `\b...\b` wrapper is unreachable.
     *

     * would report removals of assertions that never existed.
