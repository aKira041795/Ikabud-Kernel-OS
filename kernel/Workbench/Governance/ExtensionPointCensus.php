/**
 * Extension point consumption census — a point is created by its first consumer.
 *
 * Declared extension points are published contract surface: a third party may
 * build against them. A point no manifest consumes has no evidence it works,
 * no test that would notice it breaking, and no way to distinguish "supported
 * extension point" from "a name in a manifest". This census makes that surface
 * visible without changing it.
 *
 * The comparison is a pure function of two arrays: it reads no manifests, opens
 * no database, writes nothing and mutates nothing. Reading the real sources
 * belongs to the command that feeds it.
 *
 * TWO invariants, and the distinction matters:
 *
 *   - an ORPHAN contribution — a module contributing to a point no manifest
 *     declares — is a defect in code and is counted as an orphan. It means a
 *     contribution that can never be invoked, or a typo in a point name.
 *   - an UNCONSUMED declared point is REPORTED, never fatal. A census that
 *     failed on it would be permanently red, and a guard that is always red is
 *     a guard nobody reads.
 *
 * An orphan consumes nothing, because the point it names does not exist, so it
 * never contributes to the consumed count.
