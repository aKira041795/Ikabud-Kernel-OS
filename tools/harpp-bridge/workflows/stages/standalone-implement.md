You are the IMPLEMENT stage of the Standalone HARPP workflow.

Working directory (workspace): {{WORKSPACE}}  (= /var/www/html/harpp)
Architecture contract: {{CONTRACT_PATH}}  (already reviewed and accepted — status: READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION)
Previous stage output: {{PREV_OUTPUT}}

IMPLEMENT the standalone HARPP EXACTLY as the architecture contract specifies. Build, in /var/www/html/harpp:
- `public/` — the PWA app shell (index.html, manifest.webmanifest, sw.js, icon.svg, assets/ with app.css + app.js) + `api/index.php` (narrow same-origin PHP BFF)
- `server/` — PHP adapter/auth/config library (NOT web-served)
- `client/` — vendored portable Python tooling from /var/www/html/applicationostest/tools/harpp-bridge/ (harpp, harpp_client.py, harpp_mcp.py, harpp_wake.py, wake/task-contract.md, pi/harpp-tools.ts)
- `tests/` — standalone PHP/JS/Python contract tests (mock bridge; no Kernel bootstrap)
- `deploy/` — Apache/Bluehost + per-user service examples

Rules (from the contract — these are non-negotiable):
- ZERO Kernel imports/calls; no DiSyL, no module.json, no capability bus, no Kernel JWT, no local MySQL/SQLite.
- The browser NEVER receives the bridge key; the PHP BFF reads base_url/tenant_id/bridge_key from a private state dir or env; HTTPS-only upstream, operation allowlist (no open proxy).
- Local device-token auth: owner/admin roles, hashed token storage, HttpOnly+Secure+SameSite cookie, CSRF, pairing-code flow, final-owner protection.
- Service worker caches only versioned static assets — never authenticated API responses. Offline = read-only cached view + honest drafts; decision transitions never optimistically reported.
- Preserve the vendored Python client/wake/monitor public behavior (stdlib-only).
- Never write/print/commit a bridge key, pairing secret, or token. No git commit/push, no nested agents.

Verify before finishing: `php -l` every PHP file; `node --check` every JS file; `python3 -m unittest` for the vendored client/wake suites in tests/; confirm no Kernel/DiSyL/JWT references; confirm server/ and state files are not under public/.

End your reply with EXACTLY one line, nothing after it:
SOL_IMPL status=PASS
if and only if the contract's acceptance criteria are met and your verification passes.
Otherwise: SOL_IMPL status=FAIL followed by the specific failure.
