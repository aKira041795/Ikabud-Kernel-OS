## What This Means

### GitHub license display

- GitHub currently shows `Unknown and 2 other licenses found` for this repository.
- That is expected for the current open-core layout: the top-level `LICENSE` file is a repository-wide notice that points to both `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL`, so GitHub cannot classify the repo as a single standard license.
- The authoritative component boundary is this file (`LICENSING.md`), not the single-license badge GitHub would normally infer for a uniformly licensed repository.

### For developers and contributors

- You can freely use, fork, and build on all **Community Edition** components
- Community modules can be extended, modified, and redistributed under MIT
- The `kernel/Contracts/` interfaces define the stable module development API

### For production deployments

- Self-hosted production use of **Enterprise Edition** components requires a commercial license
- Contact noah2.omamalin@gmail.com for commercial licensing terms
- Evaluation, development, and testing use of all components is permitted

### For module developers

- Build modules against the MIT-licensed `kernel/Contracts/` interfaces
- Your modules are yours — Ikabud's license does not infect module code that only uses the public contract surface
- Modules that embed or modify Enterprise components must respect the commercial license
